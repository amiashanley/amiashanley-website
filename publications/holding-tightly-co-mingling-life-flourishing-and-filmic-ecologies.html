                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>Firmly emplaced within a soundscape incorporating movement, prayer, music, human-made and
                        environmental sounds, the film <em>Holding Tightly</em> (2021) closely observes the performance
                        and practice of a series of healing encounters in the Baucau Municipality of Timor-Leste. The
                        lakadou (tubed zither) played in consort with dance in the opening and closing scenes is used by
                        ritual specialists to communicate with the dai (ancestral nature spirit), which will eventually
                        enable good health and more-than-human flourishing. Integral to conveying a sense of such
                        flourishing are the sounds of everyday Timorese life which are pronounced in the film. The
                        combination of rich and lively co-mingled soundscapes with the variety of healing modalities and
                        exchanges depicted allows the audience to be drawn into the complexities and textures of
                        Timorese pathways and aspirations for life-flourishing. Such flourishing emerges from forms of
                        belief and care that are grounded in deep connections and exchanges between people and their
                        environments. In this paper we explore the ways in which the relational sonic and visual
                        richness of experience recorded in film opens new and productive ways of working with Indigenous
                        knowledge and thinking about ecology.</p>

                    <p>This introductory course explores sound as material, medium, and practice within contemporary art
                        contexts. Through lectures, discussions, close reading, close listening, and practical making,
                        students investigate how sound and listening engage with contemporary ecologies and
                        technologies—materially, aesthetically, and culturally.</p>
                    <p>The course traces the development of sound arts across the intersections of experimental music,
                        technologies, and ecological practices before moving into engagement with sites through field
                        recording and soundwalking. Critical examination of listening biases, positionalities, and
                        access addresses whiteness, heteronormativity, and class within sound studies and auditory
                        cultures. Students explore performance practices such as liveness and collaborative
                        improvisation, while investigating spatial relationships between architectural acoustics,
                        multi-channel compositions, and sound installation.</p>
                    <p>Later sessions investigate speculative listening, auditory imaginings, and possible sonic
                        futures, as well as the role of sound technologies including hardware, software, and machine
                        learning. Technical skills development includes sound editing using digital audio workstations
                        (DAWs). The course culminates in a crit-style sharing of sound works created during the course.
                        This final session encourages critical dialogue and connection between students' practices,
                        broader sonic cultures, and contemporary art contexts.</p>

                    <p>What are the possibilities for sound design and speculative thinking to open toward multispecies
                        understandings and alternative worlds? How can sound design allow us to build speculative worlds
                        that communicate alternative possibilities?</p>
                    <p>Through themes of extinction, ecology, deep time and futures, this studio offers an opportunity
                        to explore the process of designing sounds and the creation of speculative sonic worlds. In this
                        studio students develop practical skills in recording, arranging and manipulating audio, gaining
                        hands-on experience in designing sound for a variety of contexts such as screens, browsers,
                        cinema, walking, performance and three-dimensional spaces.</p>
                    <p>In the first half of the semester students are introduced to a series of speculative scenarios
                        and provocations through three experiments in speculative sound design: designing nuclear waste
                        warning signals for future generations, creating vocalisations for extinct animals, and
                        completing sound design for sci-fi film scenes. These exercises build technical competencies
                        while exploring sound's communicative and temporal dimensions. Students subsequently develop a
                        speculative soundwalk that explores environmental ambience and spatial sound design. In the
                        second half of the semester students work collaboratively to construct a comprehensive
                        speculative sonic world, with the aim of imagining new environments, social structures, and
                        possible futures. The course concludes with reflective practice that contextualises their
                        learning through public exhibition and peer engagement across studios.</p>
                    <p>Students engage in experiments in thinking, writing, listening, and acoustic communication,
                        drawing on a host of disciplines from critical design and literary studies to ecological
                        criticism, music, field recording and audio cultures. Through workshops that centre playfulness,
                        experimentation and critical thinking, students examine examples across speculative fiction,
                        independent video games, screenplays, soundwalking and sound arts to consider the function of
                        sound within the popular imaginary and alternative futures.</p>

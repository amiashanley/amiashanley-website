                    <p>How can we use time-based media to creatively respond to the uncertainty of our times? This
                        studio begins by questioning what constitutes a site and catalyst for media making—a body, river
                        mouth, landfill, discord channel, building, event, bird's nest, or something else entirely. This
                        investigation foregrounds attunement as one of the most valuable skills in contemporary media
                        practice: the ability to sense, respond, and interpret the worlds we inhabit.</p>
                    <p>Students explore techniques for practicing attunement through time-based media—audio, video,
                        image, text, digital media, installation and browser-based technologies. Drawing on examples
                        from video works, games design, listening exercises and soundwalks, they experiment with
                        reimagining relations to everyday sites and develop skills for producing media that carries
                        cultural significance and ecological value.</p>
                    <p>The studio culminates in a major site-responsive project that demonstrates students' developing
                        sensibilities as media practitioners. Through this work, students aim to create media that
                        prompt sensations of discovery and interdependence within themselves and their audiences.
                        Together we reflect on our roles as media makers at a discombobulated moment in time—questioning
                        what if, rather than forging ahead with narratives of progress, we float, in the open ocean,
                        allowing ourselves to be present and suspended, exploring whether our current moment calls for
                        cultivating an awareness of drifting and uncertainty.</p>

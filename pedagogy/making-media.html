                    <p>This course investigates "how media thinks" through hands-on engagement with the fundamentals of
                        media making. Students learn to create media individually and collaboratively while situating
                        and evaluating their work within contemporary industry and academic contexts. Students develop
                        technical skills alongside theoretical knowledge about media-making through an iterative model:
                        a cyclical process of theorising, making, and reflecting.</p>
                    <p>Sessions include a combination of tutorials, lectures, demonstrations, practical activities, and
                        peer-review. The course begins with key components of screen media across fiction and
                        non-fiction forms, including cinematography, video editing techniques and functions, and writing
                        for visual media. Later sessions explore audio-based storytelling, sound recording, sound
                        design, and sonic perspectives, examining how different media forms construct meaning and engage
                        audiences within contemporary media futures and institutions.</p>
                    <p>The course emphasises the integration of making and thinking, craft and concept, encouraging
                        students to develop both practical proficiency and critical understanding of media as cultural
                        practice. Students undertake four assessments that scaffold the development of their technical
                        skills and media literacy: a mini media medley comprising four experimental video exercises that
                        introduce fundamental techniques; a video portrait that combines interview, b-roll, and archival
                        footage to create a short documentary piece; a collaborative audio work in podcast form that
                        critically engages with contemporary media debates; and ongoing written reflective practice that
                        theoretically situate their media-making experiments within course readings and concepts.</p>

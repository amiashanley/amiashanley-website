                   <p>Open to students from diverse disciplines, this interdisciplinary elective explores the nexus of listener experience, aural culture, and acoustic environments. The course examines how sound shapes our understanding of place, culture, and identity through both theoretical investigation and practical engagement with sonic environments.</p>
                   <p>Built around the foundational concept that soundscapes are sonic environments understood through both individual and collective perception, the course develops students' capacity to analyse and actively engage with acoustic spaces. Through physical, psychophysical, and cultural perspectives, students investigate how sound functions as both environmental phenomenon and cultural practice.</p>
                   <p>The course is delivered through a two-phase structure: theoretical grounding followed by practical application. The first phase establishes core principles of soundscape studies, examining listening practices, acoustic ecology, and the social dimensions of sound through soundscape analysis and soundscape documentation assignments. The second phase challenges students to develop proposals and design responses to real acoustic environments using both subjective listener testing and objective measurement to evaluate their impact and understand real-world acoustic challenges, culminating in the creation of a soundscape composition</p>
                   <p>This approach cultivates critical listening skills while developing practical competencies in acoustic research and environmental design. Students engage with contemporary debates around noise pollution, sonic heritage, urban planning, and the politics of sound, preparing them to undertake research and contribute to discussions about how we might create more thoughtful and equitable acoustic environments.</p>

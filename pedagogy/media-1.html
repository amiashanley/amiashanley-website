                    <p>This foundational course introduces students to the practices and values that inform academic
                        studio-based learning in media. Students learn to create media both individually and
                        collaboratively while developing capacities to situate and evaluate their work within
                        contemporary industry and academic contexts.</p>
                    <p>The course employs problem-based tasks that require students to make media in response to prompts
                        generated by current debates and research within media studies and industries. Through
                        experimental making and critical reflection, students build foundational knowledge of media
                        while challenging conventional approaches to the discipline.</p>
                    <p>Students engage with a range of production technologies to create video and audio works,
                        developing skills in analysis, synthesis, and reflection on their discipline in both local and
                        international contexts. Assessments progress from individual creative video responses through
                        collaborative video portrait projects to independent audio works, each accompanied by critical
                        reflection on creative choices and learning processes.</p>
                    <p>The course establishes the foundation for studio-based learning, emphasising the integration of
                        practical media production with critical analysis and reflective practice.</p>

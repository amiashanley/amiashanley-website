                    <p>Co-led with Joel Stern, this studio questions, how do creative sound practices and critical
                        listening inform our future relations with environments, machines, and more-than-humans? The
                        course positions sound as both mnemonic device and speculative tool, exploring how sonic
                        practices can trigger "future echoes" and open pathways to possible worlds.</p>
                    <p>Built around an eco-techno approach to sound and listening, the studio mobilises ecological
                        frameworks alongside investigations into machine listening to examine contemporary
                        complexities—from the data-driven logics of AI and platform capitalism to emerging climate
                        realities. Students develop both theoretical understanding and practical competencies, gaining
                        hands-on experience with audio recording processes, post-production techniques, and sound design
                        fundamentals using digital audio workstations.</p>
                    <p>Initial sessions introduce sound, speech, listening, and communication as sites of multi-species
                        expression, sociality, and resistance—examining how sonic practices function as forms of agency
                        and identity. Students then engage in four progressive assignments: creative investigations into
                        machine listening and how devices analyse, respond to, and mis/recognise human speech;
                        speculative soundwalks constructing future environmental ambiences; collaborative sound futures
                        exploring eco-technological relations and alternative world-making; and reflective practice
                        contextualising learning through exhibition outcomes.</p>
                    <p>Through this integration of speculative thinking, ecological awareness, and hands-on sound
                        production, students develop capacities to use creative sound practices as tools for imagining
                        and prototyping alternative environmental and technological futures.</p>

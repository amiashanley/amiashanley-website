                   <p>This course develops students' familiarity with professional media production whilst focusing on storytelling and place-based media making. The course explores issues of identity and place, and aims to develop dialogue and awareness of what it means to tell stories and create media on Indigenous land as a foundation for imagining shared futures, addressing decolonisation, representation, and biases in storytelling media.</p>
                   <p>The curriculum emphasises how notions of identity and meanings of place shape storytelling approaches and media practice. Through lectures, workshops, and hands-on production exercises, students engage with documentary theory and practice whilst exploring the relationships between story, place, and identity. Learning activities integrate critical analysis with creative production, encouraging students to consider what story is, what story does, and what story might be.</p>
                   <p>Assessments progress from individual small video works through collaborative map-based audio projects to independent video essays, each exploring different aspects of place-based storytelling. The course culminates in reflective writing that synthesises learning about the connections between identity, place, and media practice.</p>
                   <p>Students work with professional media equipment and develop capacities to adapt their practice within complex cultural and historical contexts, building foundations for ethical and culturally responsive media production.</p>

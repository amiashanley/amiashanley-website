                        <p>I’m interested in the emergence of listening and signal-making across sonic ecologies and
                            sound-sensing infrastructures.</p>
                        <p>Frequently using site-responsive practices, my work questions how sound becomes
                            instrumentalised, entangled, and contested—particularly through queer and transgender
                            studies. Within these frameworks, sound becomes a medium for investigation and a tool for
                            resistance, refusal, and re-imagining.</p>
                        <p>These inquiries intersect with auditory agency and the biopolitics of communication.
                            Together, they raise questions about who or what is being listened to, how meaning is
                            assigned, and the power structures embedded in sonic relations.</p>
                        <p>Across spatialised composition, installation, sound sculpture, creative computing, writing,
                            and performance, I develop sonic propositions that challenge fixed categories, invite
                            alternative modes of sensing, and offer ways to relate across species, environments, and
                            technologies.</p>

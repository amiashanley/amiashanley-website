                    <p>Welcome to my website. I explore how listening and signal-making entangle with sound-sensing infrastructures, sonic ecologies, and representational practices.</p>
                    <p>Often using site-responsive and speculative methods, my work examines how sound becomes instrumentalised, entangled, and contested—particularly through queer ecologies and transgender studies. Within these frameworks, sound becomes a medium for investigation and a tool for resistance, refusal, and re-imagining.</p>
                    <p>These inquiries intersect with sound technologies, auditory agency, and the biopolitics of communication. Together, they raise questions about who or what is being listened to, how meaning is assigned, and the power structures embedded in sonic relations.</p>
                    <p>By attending to these entanglements through spatialised composition, installation, sculpture, creative computing, writing, and performance, I aim to generate sonic propositions that challenge fixed categories, invite alternative modes of sensing, and offer ways to relate across species, environments, and technologies. I am currently based in London.</p>

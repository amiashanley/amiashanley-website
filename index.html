        <p>that's me in the back - i'm building something new. come back later and check it out</p>
        <p>in the meantime, hmu at @amias_hanley / amiashanley@gmail.com</p>
        <p> Through site-responsive and speculative sonic encounters, I explore the ways sound is instrumentalised, entangled, and contested, particularly though queer ecologies and transgender studies, where it acts not just as a medium but as a method of resistance, refusal, and re-imagining.</p>
        <p>These concerns intersect with non-human agency, technological mediation, and the biopolitics of communicationâ€”raising questions about who or what is being listened to, how meaning is assigned, and the power structures embedded in sonic mediation. My practice continues to investigate how listening and signal-making are never neutral acts but are enmeshed within histories of surveillance, environmental politics, and representation. By attending to these entanglements, I aim to generate sonic propositions that challenge fixed categories, invite alternative modes of sensing, and propose new ways of relating across species, environments, and technologies</p>

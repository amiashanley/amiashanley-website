                    <p>Welcome to my website. I work with sound and write about it. I’m interested in the emergence of listening and signal-making across sonic ecologies and sensing infrastructures.</p>
                    <p>Often using site-responsive practices, my work examines how sound becomes instrumentalised, entangled, and contested—particularly through queer and transgender studies. Within these frameworks, sound becomes a medium for investigation and a tool for resistance, refusal, and re-imagining.</p>
                    <p>These inquiries intersect with sound technologies, auditory agency, and the biopolitics of communication. Together, they raise questions about who or what is being listened to, how meaning is assigned, and the power structures embedded in sonic relations.</p>
                    <p>In attending to these questions through spatialised composition, installation, sculpture, creative computing, writing, and performance, I aim to generate sonic propositions that challenge fixed categories, invite alternative modes of sensing, and offer ways to relate across species, environments, and technologies.</p>
